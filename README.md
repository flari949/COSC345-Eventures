# COSC345-Project
## About The Project
The Eventures application project is a group project for the COSC345 university paper at the University Of Otago. This project aims to design and create a useful application for the betterment of a user or society with the primary programming language as C/C++. The project requires the incorporation of two or more publicly available datasets (of different data domains) that can be combined to create additional meaning.

### Eventures
Eventures aims to combine [EventFinda](eventfinda.co.nz) event data along with [Land Information New Zealand](https://data.linz.govt.nz) geographical map data to superimpose event data on a visual interface for a unique and valuable exploration and discovery application.

        ```

## Target Audience
This application is aimed at university students who don't have the time or the knowledge of local events required to attend. This application has the potential to benefit many more than just the target audience however this is the group the application will cater for the most. Notably, the application will also serve to be of great aid to event organisers who wish to spread knowledge and awareness of their events.
